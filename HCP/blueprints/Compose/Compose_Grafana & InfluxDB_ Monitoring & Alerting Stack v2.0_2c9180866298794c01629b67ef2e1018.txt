A wide range of data reporting agents can stream data to the InfluxDB instance, to begin capturing from Linux & Windows hosts it is suggested to deploy Telegraf on your hosts and point them towards the IP & port of the deployed InfluxDB container. The agents will automatically create the database. Add your InfluxDB instance as a datasource in Grafana and users can begin building custom dashboards.",
